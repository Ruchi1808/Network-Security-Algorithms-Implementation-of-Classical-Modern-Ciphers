# Network Security Algorithms (Educational Project)

A network security project focused on the **implementation and understanding of cryptographic algorithms**, covering both **classical** and **modern** encryption techniques.

This project is designed for **academic learning** and to build a strong foundation in **cryptography and network security concepts**.

---

## 📌 Project Description

Cryptography is a core component of network security, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and secure communication between systems.

This project demonstrates how different encryption algorithms work internally by implementing them in code and applying them to sample inputs.

## 🔐 Algorithms Implemented

### ✅ Caesar Cipher
- Classical substitution cipher
- Shifts each character by a fixed key value

### ✅ Playfair Cipher
- Digraph substitution cipher
- Uses a 5×5 matrix generated from a keyword

### ✅ DES (Data Encryption Standard)
- Symmetric key encryption algorithm
- Uses a shared secret key for encryption and decryption

### ✅ RSA Algorithm
- Asymmetric encryption algorithm
- Uses public and private keys for secure data exchange
